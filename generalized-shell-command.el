no region is selected and an argument is a passed, run a shell command
and place its output after the mark as in C-u M-x `shell-command' (C-u

shell and replace the text in that region with the output of the shell
command as in C-u M-x `shell-command-on-region' (C-u M-|). If a region
is selected AND an argument is passed (via C-u) send output to another
